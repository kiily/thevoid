One must somehow be able to acquire knowledge in the world, in the form of memory while being able to be as present as possible with **the real.** What does this all mean?\n\nKnowledge is acquired by processes of the brain as one learns new facts, new ideas, new names for things. I must name that bird, I must name that tree or that plant, or I must remember the name of that city or that sea. We slowly build our internal database, full of interconnected concepts, methods, mechanisms, and experiences. Basically, everything that has been retained during our entire lives.\n\n**The real** is more complicated, it refers to what Jiddu Krishnamurti calls **what is**. This is raw reality, what you see without your mind, without labels or words. It is a canvas where you watch the whole process of thought unfold. And then your mind is quiet, suddenly focused without trying, actually paying _**attention.**_\n\nIn our busy days, we have embedded routines, practices, things that we call life. And our life becomes mechanical in all its forms. At the same time, to always revel in reality, permanently, would be very difficult and require a lot of practice (ironically) of meditation and much tougher to embed into anyone's day to day. There are things that are important, but this is not to say that we cannot tap into **the real** if we _**pay attention**_ in a given moment.\n\nI don't like to define words like 'truth'. After all, who am I to be defining such a thing? Rather, I'd prefer to just ask some questions. Is truth permanent? Or does it change from moment to moment? Is the truth my opinion or yours? If knowledge is shaped by prior conditioning, can it be synonymous with truth, or is it merely a collection of facts? Can we be free of ideas; could truth be found there?\n\n\"_**It is only when the mind is free from idea that there can be experiencing. Ideas are not truth; and truth is something to be experienced directly, from moment to moment.\" -** J. Krishnamurti \"Action Without Idea\", Book of Life, 16:02_\n\nI believe there is true balance in that moment and I have felt it in some form, tapped into it just by thinking. It sounds completely crazy but I was fortunate to have someone really insist that I try it. There is energy and alertness in this state, sort of like a state of deep work but about things in life and only in the present moment, over and over again.\n\nI suppose the main thing about this meditation is to ask yourself these questions rather than look for answers because when you look for answers you are striving for something and the mind is not free. It is busy with the problem itself, and the energy it costs to find a solution. Thought requires energy. For instance, a study conducted by Dr. Robert Sapolsky and Dr. Lewis Leavitt in 1984 revealed that chess players could burn up to 6,000 calories a day during tournaments, a testament to the intense mental and physiological demands of competitive play. We waste so much of this energy being in our own minds, struggling with thoughts about the future or the past.\n\nIn essence, the balance between acquiring knowledge and being present in the raw reality of the moment is like walking a tightrope, where each step is a deliberate act of mindfulness. Our quest for knowledge, while enriching, should not detach us from the profound experience of \"**the real\"** – the unfiltered reality that exists beyond our constructed labels and concepts.\n\n_I am working on a ChatGPT bot that will be able to answer questions about this topic.

I would sit or lie down, close my eyes, and attempt to focus on my breath. My mind would wander and I would feel guilty about it, even though that was absolutely not the point. I would be able to focus and sometimes feel slightly calmer but I always needed to stop whatever I was doing to be able to focus and introspect…\n\n<div class={\"flex flex-col items-center justify-center\"}>\n  <Image src={airportImage} alt=\"The airport - generated by DALL-E\" width={600} height={400} class=\"w-full max-w-2xl h-auto\" />\n  <figcaption class=\"mt-2 text-center text-sm text-garden-secondary dark:text-garden-dark-secondary font-body\">\"The airport\" - generated by DALL-E</figcaption>\n</div>\n\nAlmost a year after the emptiness realization, I look back at how naive and ignorant I was (and well, I still am, but perhaps a bit less). This wisdom has been passed down countless generations, without a fight, without strife, without the need to impose a belief on others. After all, belief is not compatible with emptiness from the ultimate standpoint. In fact, nothing can be claimed to exist. Things are dependently arising and there is extreme beauty in this fact. This means that all things depend on one another and this relationship of contingency cannot be unseen once it has been understood. Suddenly, I can meditate with my eyes open, at any point, about anything. One simply has to inquire about the nature of anything and meditate on the contingency and emptiness of it. What does this mean?\n\nWe are quick to ascribe an essence to everything that we perceive, but upon closer inspection, we do find that nothing can be claimed to be so. When we say things are empty it may seem easier to think that this is a characteristic that things have, but rather, it is the absence of a property (inherent existence) that we assume to be a property of all things in the world. And when I say all things, I mean this literally. There is no concept, thought, or idea that was ever created by mankind that escapes this fact. Just like the fish lives in water without knowing it, we live in our thoughts and concepts. But let's return to meditation, what does it mean to meditate on emptiness? An example will put it best:\n\nI am writing this as I wait for my flight back to London. Let's meditate on the airport. First of all, where is it? Sure, I know I am in what we all conventionally agree is an airport, in a specific location in Luxembourg but let's try to find \"it\". Is the airport in the people? Is it in the planes? Is it in the airlines? Is it in the duty-free shop? Is it in the check-in queues or the runway? Could these exist without one another? I am not asking anyone to believe in anything, I simply ask questions in the hope that you can inquire into them with me. This structure that I am in, has required countless materials, people, work, time, etc to build. Things that may have come from across the world through long journeys and countless hands, all of them creating a set of characteristics that we can now identify as an airport. And we can inquire deeper into any of those. Take the people that built this place, countless infinite universes of ineffable feelings and thoughts that had to come together to create this thing that I can now \"use\" for my convenience. People with all sorts of backgrounds, goals, families, problems… An impossibly vast number of variables that one cannot even hold in the mind. All of it depends on everything else, and it depends on me, and those around me… This can go on ad infinitum.\n\nIf you follow this, you might notice how the mind is suddenly quiet. Clarity and peace arise immediately from this exercise, even if for just a split second. Thinking about all of the things that are around what we simply call \"an airport\" makes it obvious that we are making a mistake in labeling it as such. It is much more than what we initially assumed. Let's go back to finding this airport. Is it in any of these things? Or is it a gross, yet useful approximation that our mind does to understand the world around us? There is no right or wrong, only a convention that allows us to communicate.\n\nNevertheless, it is a misconception about the true nature of the world. The real, what is really there, is seen as we pay attention. Everything is unique, ever-changing, and constantly mutating. This applies to everything: thoughts, feelings, objects, fears… The whole conceptual world is at stake. There is harmony in emptiness and dependent arising. We need to understand dependent arising to understand emptiness and emptiness to delve deeper into dependent arising. The teachings of the Buddha still last to this day, but there is no such thing as \"the Buddha\" from the ultimate standpoint. This is the beauty of all this. Everything is new, and only the present is **actual** reality, moving in a continuum.\n\nSo look around, observe nature, people, and your own thoughts, and see what you will find. When you mislabel a feeling such as \"anxiety\" ask yourself? What am I doing here? What is anxiety? Where is it? Who is feeling it? Can you claim that there is an \"I\" that feels it? If so, where is this \"I\"?\n\nMeditate, and be present and you'll find that life becomes that much easier to handle.\n\n---\n\n*Thanks for reading!*\n\n*If you like my writing, please share it with friends, family, or anyone that you think might enjoy it.

At a glance, this does not mean much to most people and for a while it meant nothing to me at all. It was over the summer of 2022, that through a friend, I began to understand the deep philosophical consequences of this concept.\n\nI can only describe this realization as some sort of mind hack that can be used to immediately feel grounded or to process feelings by understanding them for what they really are. Since then, I have experienced a deep sense of calm and the understanding completely transformed my experience of meditation.\n\nThe aim of this short piece is twofold:\n\n1. To formalize my understanding of emptiness by being able to explain it in simpler terms.\n2. Help others understand it better so that it may help them as it helped me.\n\nI will first cover some of the events prior to discovering emptiness before diving a bit deeper into the philosophy itself.\n\n## Book of Life - the first read\n\nIn January 2022, my friend recommended the \"Book of Life\" by J. Krishnamurti (J.K.). I read the short meditations and watched some of his talks on Youtube. The concepts were interesting but they seemed hard to grasp. There were expressions like \"the observer is the observed\", \"a mind that is free\", \"*what is*\" or \"putting aside screens\". This mostly revolved around seeing things for what they are. While there was an obvious \"aura\" of calm and peace about the man, I was not ready to read that book nor to understand his wise teachings. The first read left some lingering thoughts and that knowledge lay dormant; the book went back onto the shelf. In the meantime, I got a new job and the months went by…\n\n## Nature and deep work\n\nDuring this time, I had been actively improving my ability to focus on demand by getting into the habit of doing regular deep work and making a conscious effort to be fully focused for uninterrupted chunks of time. I was training the \"focus\" muscle. As spring was coming to an end, I found myself increasingly interested in nature. Looking at birds, going on walks, watching sunsets, staring at the moon... I had begun to pay more attention to my surroundings through the concept of Quests / Awe walks - a type of guided, active meditation outside.\n\n## The Middle Way\n\nEventually, through some combination of the events above and a friend's explanation, I finally understood the concept of emptiness. From the Buddhist standpoint, and particularly Nāgārjuna's *Mūlamadhyamakakārikā* (The Root Verses on the Middle Way), all things are empty of intrinsic nature and arise through dependent origination.\n\nWhat this means is that nothing exists independently or has a fixed essence. Everything we experience - thoughts, emotions, objects, even our sense of self - arises in dependence on causes, conditions, and our conceptual frameworks. When we understand this deeply, we can see through the illusion of solid, independent existence that normally dominates our perception.\n\nIndeed, from Nāgārjuna's standpoint the entire \"everyday world\" is non-existent.\n\nThere is a nuance in what we mean by \"existing\". The Buddhists use this to mean \"inherent existence\" which is what Nāgārjuna is debating. This is opposed to \"conventional existence\" where we all are in agreement that things exist conventionally; but do things exist in and of themselves? Do they have an essence?\n\nNāgārjuna's text develops on this thesis and eventually culminates with the assertion that emptiness is itself also empty. I plan to write some other short pieces around some of the chapters that I have found particularly interesting and to continue expanding on this.\n\n## Things and words\n\nBefore leaving for today let's go through an analogy:\n\nPicture a table. As an everyday object, it depends on us to be understood as well as on our concept of what a \"table\" is and has evolved to be. But it does not need our recognition to exist - when you look at a table and label it as such, you are taking an arbitrary slice of space-time where you, as the referent, perceive the table as a \"table\".\n\n\"One has to realize that the word is not the thing - like the word tree is not the tree, is not the actual fact\" (\"Book of Life\" - 19/05). The tree, just like the table only exists conventionally…\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n* The Book of Life\n* *Mūlamadhyamakakārikā*\n\nI'm experimenting with writing about this topic which I have found fascinating.

They have been part of my experience since I learned how to speak, and for a long time, I never thought deeply about them. Turns out that inwardly, in our heads, words can be treacherous if we do not see them for what they are. Having understood their **true nature** and their emptiness, I can distance myself from them and watch as the brain works and does its thing. The byproduct of this is that ultimately it would make no sense to make judgements about a word but I wanted to start by doing that nonetheless. I don't like the word enlightenment. Besides the fact that it is a word (with all the reified baggage it carries), it describes a permanent state of bliss or self-knowledge, a \"higher state\" that seems to only be within reach for the wise figures or the spiritual monks. There is no such thing as enlightenment, but despite that fact, it remains a word that resonates with people when talking about \"the place\" we all want to reach.\n\nI wanted to preface this text with the previous paragraph and start by reasserting that I do not claim to be \"enlightened\" and that despite being fond of the concept of *Nirvana*, I cannot claim that I am completely free of the afflictions of being human. With that said, we can move on.\n\nThe idea for this piece was started by something a friend said as we shared philosophical perspectives and delved into the similarities of the concept of emptiness with his idea around an infinitely all-absorbing \"hole\" in which everything can be broken down into smaller components. As I explained how I had come to the realization, I mentioned the things I had been doing at FLOWN (the company I work for): meditations, regular journalling, stream-of-consciousness sessions, walks in nature, intention setting, and deep work. He said: \"Sounds like you are the first example of corporate enlightenment\". I chuckled. Not sure I had heard those two words put together before.\n\nAll these things were helping me be more productive at work and were key in allowing me to introspect way more frequently than I previously ever did. We also have this running theme of birds at FLOWN and strangely, observing these wonderful creatures became a newfound habit. Of course, there were many other factors along the way but I still think this shift of mentality set a great foundation. I would previously have said that I was proud of this but I am much more grateful to have changed the perspective to: \"What is pride? Who is this \"I\" that is proud?\". The same goes for the \"I am grateful\" but I think no one needs convincing that gratefulness is probably a good one to have lingering in your mind.\n\nI also wanted to leave at least one practical tip as I know these rambles can get hard to follow (I hope you forgive me). So, how is any of this useful? I'd say that being able to see thoughts for what they are not only massively increases your attention and your ability to focus. If you deeply understand that a consequence of the ineffable nature of the world is that the **present** is the only real thing, you will find it much easier to clear your head. With that, the mental energy you would previously spend in \"being in your head\" is freed up and can be harnessed to focus. I recently read a quote by James Clear that I thought would be relevant here:\n\n> \"Arguably the most important skill is controlling your attention. This goes beyond merely avoiding distractions. The deeper skill is finding the highest and best use for your time, given what is important to you.\"\n\nI mostly agree with the above, but would go further. Applying this to your work is a great thing, but try to apply it to everything, all moments require attention to be fully experienced. And it is not my place to tell you what that experience is and even if I wanted to, I could never represent what I *actually* feel with words. So when you next look at something, just notice your brain \"saying\": \"Hey, that's a ***THING,*** and it has properties of this ***THING***.\" Look beyond the label, by observing it and clearing it from your mind.\n\nIf you made it this far, I hope this text sparked some ideas in you.

I notice how the frame of my glasses seems to be in the way of some level of observation.\n\nPlain, the immovable wall continues its stare contest. It curves on its right-hand side into an arch that connects with the same wall on the other side, creating a small concave space where the light reflects in a blue/green hue.

If that is the case, where is it then?\"\n\nA: \"It is there, I am pointing at it!\"\n\nQ: \"Yes, but is the tree in the bark, is it in the leaves, in the branches, in the roots, in the fruit or flowers it may bear?\"\n\nA: \"Well, it is all of those things combined.\"\n\nQ: \"I must ask, when these characteristics combine, at which point do they become a tree?\"\n\nA: \"It's tricky, I suppose the tree is a result of all of that?\"\n\nQ: \"Can we agree that the tree is dependent on all of its parts to be labelled as such? In other words, for it to exist as a \"tree\" it depends on all of its subparts?\"\n\nI'll pause and let you answer this hypothetical dialog as you wish. For me, it seems hard for to deny the following fact: if the tree is the sum of its component parts then it must be dependent on them.\n\nWords can be deceiving. We have this idea of a \"tree\", this amalgamation of features that results in an identity we assign to something that we see. We are claiming that the thing we see has an identity, it is a \"tree\". We must then dig deeper into this idea of identity. Do things that change have identity? Surely, change and identity are juxtaposed. If there is change, there is impermanence. Identity cannot be established in a state of impermanence. As time unfolds our so-called \"tree\" is changing continuously, just like everything else. Can we agree that calling it \"a tree\" is imprecise at the very least?\n\nCan you spot the gap? Here is this thing that we confidently label as a tree but that upon closer inspection we find that not only does it depend on all of its parts but it also cannot assume a permanent identity. So can it be said to be a tree? Aren't we making a mistake in ascribing identity to it when we agree on the above?\n\nLanguage and words are a wonderful tool, one that sets us apart from the rest of creatures. Yet words are metaphors, they are approximations. All words are metaphors that we take for granted; they are attempts at describing the experience of reality. So can this \"tree\" that we see, be said to be a \"tree\" from this logical standpoint? It seems that this thing I observe and experience can never be fully captured with any word. The experience is beyond the mind, in the sense that it is beyond what language can describe.\n\n\"Do you know that even when you look at a tree and say, 'That is an oak tree', or that is a banyan tree', the naming of the tree, which is botanical knowledge, has so conditioned your mind that the word comes between you and actually seeing the tree? To come in contact with the tree you have to put your hand on it and the word will not help you to touch it.\" ― Jiddu Krishnamurti, Freedom from the Known\n\nLet's break this down a little. It is by labelling, by finding the specific taxonomy, classifying, and intellectualising that we make an attempt to capture our understanding of what we observe; and this is important. It enables science to move forward, it enables us to navigate nature. This is conditioning and one must remember that the word is merely an approximation of the thing. When you label a tree as a tree, you cease to look at it. The word gets in the way of the experience. Can you see this happening? Can you see yourself labelling the world? What if we were to let go of all that?\n\nIt may seem extreme to question language itself and all that we have known. Yet, there is something special to be found when we let go of the word, even if briefly. When we are really paying attention, that is, experiencing the thing without labelling it (i.e. seeing the tree as raw reality), the mind becomes still. Mental energy is no longer dissipated by thought / the mental process of intellectualisation and instead is fully devoted to the experience of the thing (what is).\n\nThis is not a denial of concepts, that would be something more similar to nihilism and outright insanity. Words may be imprecise but they are the tools we have got to communicate with one another. But when we are looking inside, within the confines of our own mind, when we are occupied with thought... Are concepts necessary there? What if you were to let go of them? Could we accept that there is an element of philosophical fallacy in concepts and ideas? And if we look at the tree again, can we find something new in that \"tree\" we claim to always have seen? And if this \"tree\" is unlike any other we have encountered: its unique configuration, location, position, how can we possibly describe this tree and the one next to it with the same word? Ultimately, the identity we ascribe to them is merely a convention.\n\nI like the distinction in Mādhyamaka Buddhism between the conventional/everyday truth and the ultimate truth. From the ultimate standpoint, we have to be ruthless with the way we analyse everything. No concept escapes this analysis. In fact, the whole body of knowledge ever created by humans will always remain a man-made creation. From the ultimate standpoint, one must accept things as empty, i.e. not having an inherent existence, always changing from moment to moment, unable to assume an identity that is constant over time. And in this space, true freedom from the mind can be found.\n\nFrom this standpoint, I have never seen a \"tree\" because there is no such thing as a \"tree\". There is only direct experience of the thing itself...\n\nSo here are a bunch of questions that are to be experienced for oneself. What you will find is ultimately up to you. All I have to say, is that I wish someone had made me question this sooner.\n\n\n\nReferences:\n- [Nagarjuna - Mūlamadhyamakakārikā](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C5%ABlamadhyamakak%C4%81rik%C4%81)\n- [Jiddu Krishnamurti - Freedom from the Known](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Freedom-Known-J-Krishnamurti/dp/1846042135)","src/content/garden/have-you-ever-seen-a-tree.mdx","ff8612bb4522c5b5","have-you-ever-seen-a-tree.mdx","photos-and-polaroids",{id:125,data:127,body:138,filePath:139,digest:140,legacyId:141,deferredRender:34},{title:128,description:129,publishDate:130,category:17,tags:131,connections:135},"Photos and polaroids","A reflection on the nature of experience versus representation, exploring how photos capture only fractions of reality and serve as glimpses into the flaws of the conceptual world.",["Date","2023-03-26T00:00:00.000Z"],[132,133,19,134,42,24],"experience","conceptual","photography",[136],{title:28,url:137},"https://kiily.substack.com/p/photos-and-polaroids","import { Image } from \"astro:assets\";\nimport sunsetImage from \"../../assets/garden/photos-polaroids.webp\";\n\n*26/03/2023 - A sudden urge to write arises.*\n\nI was printing some photos for the memories section of my journal that I fill in generally from things of the month. I had seen this beautiful sunset with a double rainbow the other day and took a photo of it. Once printed, it was but a fraction of the photo, the photo a fraction of the experience. While this is probably obvious to many already, those moments are not the same, despite some of us still claiming they actually show the \"same\" thing. This is untenable from the ultimate standpoint, how can anything be the same? I urge people to dig deeper. What is the nature of this experience we describe? Is there such a thing as nature or essence?\n\nThis photo is a good glimpse into the flaws of the conceptual world, and if for a moment we grossly assumed that the photo was the reality, then the polaroid would be the concept we have of it. Imperfect, but \"good enough\" for our brain to label it and move on. This is constantly happening, watch yourself do it. Look at anything, whatever you want, and watch your brain do all the things it does. If any thought is reified, by not paying attention to this process, then your brain might drift off in that direction. This seems to be a type of very free \"meditation\" in which you can inquire about the emptiness of everything to reach the conclusion from the \"ultimate standpoint\". This may sound ominous but merely means that we understand the conventional world as being empty of inherent existence, interdependent, contingent, impermanent, and all those other nice words we have created to capture it. There is no teaching here, merely questions for us to ask ourselves. The experience itself will always be ineffable, but nothing prevents us from coming to this realisation in a flash. Well, nothing but that thing we call \"I\"…\n\n*Below, the two images side-by-side. Left, the photo on my phone.

There was a cartoon called \"The Land Before Time\" where they chased this wonderful and prosperous land that would give them an abundance of food and water, enough to feed entire generations. The Great Valley, it was called. As I explore the Torres del Paine National Park, I feel like I have found a land worthy of this childhood cartoon.\n\n<div class={\"flex flex-col items-center justify-center\"}>\n  <Image src={torresImage} alt=\"Torres del Paine National Park - Majestic towers and mountains shaped by millions of years\" width={600} height={400} class=\"w-full max-w-2xl h-auto\" />\n  <figcaption class=\"mt-2 text-center text-sm text-garden-secondary dark:text-garden-dark-secondary font-body\">Torres del Paine National Park, Chile - A land worthy of The Great Valley</figcaption>\n</div>\n\nFirst, words or photographs cannot possibly do justice to the wonderful sights of these mountains, shaped by the earth over millions of years. How can one feel important in the world and within themselves when confronted with a sight like this? The towers, the horns, the snow, the glacier, the turquoise waters, the reflection of the sun on the small waves, the slow gusts of wind, the songbirds...\n\nThere is simply too much to take in and so many labels to remove. Could a sight like this bring calm to even the most disturbed of spirits? Could it bring peace to the most disquiet minds?\n\nIt is impossible not to feel inspired here, to want to describe the indescribable, to want to verbalize and photograph it all. Most will say this is why they come. While one may document experience, nothing will replace the moment when we first set sight upon these mountains. I make sure to pay attention, not with the labels and the screens but simply to look and see the beauty for what it is. Because beauty does not need to be explained, it does not need anything at all. No judgements, no scientific names. The true beauty of \"_what is_\" is always behind the screen of labels, and once that screen is removed, then the truth will surface. A truth which is without opinion, without conditioning, without right or wrong. A truth that simply is.\n\nMay we all look at the world as we look at these beautiful sights of nature.","src/content/garden/the-land-before-time.mdx","4e3e7f2fc6f1c5ff","the-land-before-time.mdx","the-pull-of-the-conceptual",{id:161,data:163,body:173,filePath:174,digest:175,legacyId:176,deferredRender:34},{title:164,description:165,publishDate:166,category:17,tags:167,connections:170},"The pull of the conceptual","A spontaneous stream of consciousness exploring the tension between the conceptual world of thoughts and memories versus the immediate reality of the present moment.",["Date","2023-03-03T00:00:00.000Z"],[42,100,133,168,19,169],"present-moment","awareness",[171],{title:28,url:172},"https://kiily.substack.com/p/the-pull-of-the-conceptual","import { Image } from \"astro:assets\";\nimport emptinessDiamondImage from \"../../assets/garden/emptiness-diamond-cutter.webp\";\n\n*28/06/2022 - A spontaneous stream of consciousness about emptiness.*\n\n<div class={\"flex flex-col items-center justify-center\"}>\n  <Image src={emptinessDiamondImage} alt=\"Emptiness, the diamond cutter\" width={600} height={400} class=\"w-full max-w-2xl h-auto\" />\n  <figcaption class=\"mt-2 text-center text-sm text-garden-secondary dark:text-garden-dark-secondary font-body\">Emptiness, the diamond cutter (DALL-E)</figcaption>\n</div>\n\nThere is it, every day, every moment. I see it. Plain. What it really is. The conceptual world that flutters around my head. A series of made of thoughts, some that may serve me and some that try to pull me back to the dream I once lived in. With the conceptual, there is no learning, only previous experience, only pre-gathered and memorised knowledge. Behind it, behind what was a thick curtain of smoke is the real, the actual thing, the only moment that really matters. You see the thoughts cross your mind and acknowledge them, but suddenly you see them for what they are. A train goes by, screeching happily through the tracks, passing one of his friends, crossing paths that will never be crossed again in the same way. Because every moment is ephemeral, and only exists when it really happens. Nothing else really matters in the end, the real is now here to catch me. To remind me that this is where life is constantly happening and renewing itself forever. In conceptual terms, that is a beautiful thought. A thought that brings peace, quiet and clarity to the mind. A thought that simply is, empty. Just like all else. Empty of meaning, of experience, constantly new.\n\nThe conceptual world attempts to pull me back over, and over, but once one has seen, how can one go back? It is like finally seeing a lie and changing the established belief. I will always be ready to change the established belief. As I notice the small gap in my computer keyboard, I see the keys for what they are and I see my fingers on them.

For entire lifetimes. We have done so for millennia and it seems that only a few have understood the incredibly obvious flaw in all this. Why do we keep wanting to predict the future? Why do we insist in dwelling in the past? We claim to be rational, intelligent, superior... but are we?\n\nOur brains intellectualize so much that we have become completely oblivious to the actual truth, one that is actually undeniable as well as inexplicable. And yes, I sense those scientific minds doubting every word that is about to come. But this is why we fail to get there... I was one of them, lost, in my mind, in my ideas, in my goals... not realizing how much this was actually moving me backwards or slowing me down. \n\nThen emptiness came, and the world was never the same again. \n\nBecause the real only exists in the moment. It does not care for concepts, it does not care for emotions, it does not care at all. These are just words we have come up with to communicate with one another and to represent real things that we cannot fully explain. The thinker, the one I once claimed to be, does not actually exist. It is a figment of the mind, a creation, a useful one at times, but mostly a flawed one that eternally breeds conflict and duality, the good, the bad, the rich, the poor. \n\nOnce we allow ourselves to see behind the curtain, the world will reveal itself to be \"what is\" and the beauty of it all will surface. Where does that subconscious come from? I cannot possibly answer, I am confined to merely experiencing it. The Buddha, God, the Effortless state, Quality, and many other names have been used interchangeably to try and explain this. But it is ineffable, and that is the entire point of it. \n\nSuch a simple realization, if we only accept the world as we know it is nothing more than a conceptual representation of what lies underneath.","src/content/garden/oblivious-to-facts.mdx","b4afd14ef2e140ef","oblivious-to-facts.mdx","think-like-nagarjuna",{id:196,data:198,body:209,filePath:210,digest:211,legacyId:212,deferredRender:34},{title:199,description:200,publishDate:201,category:17,tags:202,connections:206},"Think like Nāgārjuna","A philosophical inquiry into the nature of thought and thinker, exploring the interdependent relationship between thinking and the one who thinks.",["Date","2024-12-28T00:00:00.000Z"],[203,20,204,205,43,19,100],"nagarjuna","thought","buddhism",[207],{title:28,url:208},"https://kiily.substack.com/p/think-like-nagarjuna","import nagarjunaImage from '../../assets/garden/nagarjuna.webp';\nimport { Image } from 'astro:assets';\n\n*23/11/2022 - Playing with words*\n\nThere are considerations one must take into account and hopefully convey them as best as possible within the confines of the language.\n\nIs there a thought without a thinker?\n\nIf thought is, then what thought it?\n\nIf there must be a thinker\n\nHow does the thinker know it thinks?\n\nIs it because thought thinks itself a thinker?\n\nThought needs the thinker\n\nThe thinker needs the thought\n\nDo they exist independently?\n\nWho came first, the chicken or the egg? \n\nI suppose they both did, never, and at exactly the same time. \n\n\n<div class={\"flex flex-col items-center justify-center\"}>\n  <Image src={nagarjunaImage} alt=\"In deep thought in an ethereal world\" width={600} height={400} class=\"w-full max-w-2xl h-auto\" />\n  <figcaption class=\"mt-2 text-center text-sm text-garden-secondary dark:text-garden-dark-secondary font-body\">\"In deep thought in an ethereal world\" - generated by DALL-E</figcaption>\n</div>","src/content/garden/think-like-nagarjuna.mdx","c70e5ac6cbbe1af7","think-like-nagarjuna.mdx","the-zen-garden",{id:213,data:215,body:229,filePath:230,digest:231,legacyId:232,deferredRender:34},{title:216,description:217,publishDate:218,category:96,tags:219,connections:226},"The Zen Garden","A text written in chunks, reflecting different states of mind.

It was definitely triggered by the Kung Fu Panda song by Hans Zimmer and La Lang, which I recommend listening to. And of course I must challenge this \"definitely\", because it was a lot more that led to this thought than I can ever possibly understand…\n\nThe Chinese flute combined with the gentle piano took my head to a special place, totally unencumbered, as I have never seen the film. In a moment, I was transported to what I'd call the *Zen Garden*. I struggle to imagine it now, but there was a sense of overwhelming presence about the place. The garden had flowers that I cannot name, raked Japanese-style gravel and stone, and some trees that I cannot name either. And as my vocabulary of botanics gets exhausted by it's absolute absence, I must write some lines about this moment.\n\nAfter all, what the place looks like is irrelevant; it matters only what it represents. It represents a feeling in a particular moment. A slice of space-time, so thin and so instant that it is gone the moment you notice it. Well, it is renewing as long as you dwell in it. And there is only so much time to notice it, and in that noticing, noticing that there is no thought. It may seem like a strange concept, but the *Zen Garden* is in between the mind and *what is*, almost like a portal. That place is everything, and yet it is nothing, but it is full of beauty, wonder, and calm. These are the words I find to describe the ineffable. All attempts are futile, yet useful, like the description of Borges' Aleph, the sphere that contains all space-time, the universe, and infinity.\n\n> \"Arribo, ahora, al inefable centro de mi relato; empieza, aquí, mi desesperación de escritor. Todo lenguaje es un alfabeto de símbolos cuyo ejercicio presupone un pasado que los interlocutores comparten ¿cómo transmitir a los otros el infinito Aleph, que mi temerosa memoria apenas abarca?\"  \n> — El Aleph, Jose Luis Borges\n\nFor those that are into anime, Kimetsu no Yaiba (Demon Slayer) offers a couple of cool metaphors to represent the feeling in this space. The first is that of Tanjiro's *kokoro* (**心)**. I deliberately use this Japanese word as it encapsulates the ideas of heart/body/mind/spirit in one concept without being any of those things specifically. I think that is quite beautiful, but I digress… When a vassal of the demons tries to kill Tanjiro by puncturing his *kokoro*, he is faced with the immense beauty, generosity and purity of the place and is unable to fulfil his mission.\n\n<div class=\"flex flex-col items-center justify-center\">\n  <Image src={tanjiroKokoro} alt=\"A serene zen garden with raked gravel, stones, and minimal plantings representing the tranquil mental space described in the meditation\" width={600} height={400} class=\"w-full max-w-2xl h-auto\" />\n  <figcaption class=\"mt-2 text-center text-sm text-garden-secondary dark:text-garden-dark-secondary font-body\">The Zen Garden - a portal between mind and what is</figcaption>\n</div>\n\nThe other metaphor is Giyu Tomioka's 11th form of water breathing: \"Dead calm\". It is described as follows:\n\n> \"The user ceases all body movements and enters a state of complete tranquility, deflecting, blocking, and cutting any incoming attacks with imperceptible speed with their blade.\"  \n> — Kimestu no Yaiba Fandom Wiki\n\n<div class=\"flex flex-col items-center justify-center\">\n  <Image src={elevenForm} alt=\"The 11th form of water breathing - Dead calm\" width={600} height={400} class=\"w-full max-w-2xl h-auto\" />\n  <figcaption class=\"mt-2 text-center text-sm text-garden-secondary dark:text-garden-dark-secondary font-body\">The 11th form of water breathing - Dead calm</figcaption>\n</div>\n\nBoth these images represent what I am trying to convey but remain mere representations. As for the *Zen Garden,* I just know it is there, yet it is not, and since this writing is just a figment of my memory, I guess we will never know.\n\n## Part 2 - A scattered mind\n\nI continue this text at a point where my mind feels scattered from overwhelming fatigue on top of the stresses of daily life. They will pass eventually, but for now there is a series of physiological sensations that occupy my body and brain. There is fear, there is insecurity, there is anxiety, and naturally, there is endless labelling of these things.\n\nThe Ego pulls strongly when energy is low and grows when brain power is reduced. It makes itself big, caring about everything everyone says at a personal level. Every gesture is a potential offense or problem... Insecurity breeds as a result, and neuroticism runs rampant. I'm sure this resonates with others out there; it feels to me like a pretty universal human experience.\n\nUltimately, these feelings, just like the *Zen Garden,* are a product of my mind. Just like the garden, they cannot be accurately pinpointed, and in a more radical sense, the \"I\" that is the victim of all this cannot either. You may ask, Why does any of this matter after all? And you are right to ask the question. All I have to say is that this thought process is a meditation in itself and immediately grounds me and calms my thoughts.\n\nMy writing is interrupted as I change stations, and I leave it for another time with a glimpse of the garden in one corner of my eye and my demons in the other.\n\n## Post writing\n\nSince I first wrote this, I have watched the first Kung Fu Panda film and it was brilliant. I'll leave you with a great quote from Master Oogway that felt relevant to this entire narrative:\n\n> *\"You are too concerned with what was and what will be. There's a saying: Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a gift. That is why it is called the present.\"*","src/content/garden/the-zen-garden.mdx","70812faae7a23b7d","the-zen-garden.mdx","projects",["Map",235,236,276,277,340,341],"digital-garden-v1",{id:235,data:237,body:272,filePath:273,digest:274,legacyId:275,deferredRender:34},{title:238,description:239,image:240,website:241,github:242,status:243,startDate:244,endDate:245,tags:246,features:250,techStack:254,challenges:264,learnings:268},"Personal website v1","The first iteration of my personal website, built with Astro.","https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1501504905252-473c47e087f8?q=80&w=2940","https://me-beta-three.vercel.app/","https://github.com/kiily/me","Archived",["Date","2023-06-01T00:00:00.000Z"],["Date","2023-12-31T00:00:00.000Z"],[247,248,249],"Astro","MDX","TailwindCSS",[251,252,253],"Markdown-based content management","Tag and category organization","Responsive design",[255,259],{category:256,items:257},"Frontend",[258,249,248],"Next.js",{category:260,items:261},"Tools",[262,263],"Vercel","GitHub",[265,266,267],"Implementing efficient content organization","Building a fast and reliable search system","Creating a maintainable content structure",[269,270,271],"MDX integration best practices","Content management patterns","Static site generation optimization","# Digital Garden v1\n\nThe first iteration of my digital garden was an exploration into creating a personal knowledge base that could grow and evolve over time.\n\n## Project Goals\n\n1.

As the CTO, I lead the technical vision and implementation of this innovative platform.\n\n## The Vision\n\nOur goal is to help people work better and feel good doing it. We achieve this through:\n\n1. **Virtual Coworking**: Creating spaces where people can work alongside others, fostering accountability and community\n2. **Expert Sessions**: Providing access to industry experts who share knowledge and facilitate growth\n3. **Deep Work Tools**: Implementing features that help users maintain focus and track their productivity\n\n## The Science Behind FLOWN\n\nOur approach is grounded in established psychological and neurological principles:\n\n### Body Doubling and Mirror Neurons\n\nThe effectiveness of FLOWN's virtual coworking is rooted in the neuroscientific concept of mirror neurons. These specialized brain cells activate both when we perform an action and when we observe others performing similar actions. This neurological mechanism explains why working alongside others, even virtually, can enhance focus and productivity through unconscious mimicry and shared intentionality.\n\n### The Hawthorne Effect\n\nResearch has consistently shown that performance improves under observation, a phenomenon known as the Hawthorne effect. When people know they're working alongside others, even virtually, they tend to perform better. This effect is amplified in FLOWN's environment, where the presence of others creates a positive pressure that enhances focus and productivity.\n\n### Psychology of Public Commitment\n\nThe act of publicly declaring work intentions, as done in FLOWN's virtual coworking sessions, leverages the psychological principle of commitment and consistency. When people publicly state their goals, they're significantly more likely to follow through, as this creates both internal and external accountability mechanisms that drive behavior.\n\n## Technical Implementation\n\nThe platform is built on a modern tech stack that prioritizes scalability, reliability, and real-time capabilities. Some key technical achievements include:\n\n- Integrating with and modifying Daily.co for seamless video collaboration\n- Creating a robust real-time data synchronization system\n- Optimizing performance for users across different global regions\n\n## Impact and Growth\n\nSince launch, FLOWN has:\n- Hosted thousands of productive work sessions\n- Facilitated numerous expert-led workshops\n- Built a thriving community of remote workers\n- Helped users achieve significant productivity improvements\n\n## Future Direction\n\nWe continue to innovate and expand our offerings, with upcoming features including:\n- Enhanced analytics and insights\n- AI-powered productivity recommendations\n- Expanded community collaboration tools\n- Integration with popular productivity platforms","src/content/projects/flown.mdx","5a09aca064a7fc81","flown.mdx","readium",{id:340,data:342,body:380,filePath:381,digest:382,legacyId:383,deferredRender:34},{title:343,description:344,image:345,website:346,github:347,status:243,startDate:348,endDate:349,tags:350,features:354,techStack:359,challenges:372,learnings:376},"Readium","The human-friendly app to keep track of what you read","/assets/projects/readium-app.webp","https://readium-next.vercel.app/","https://github.com/kiily/readium-next",["Date","2020-03-01T00:00:00.000Z"],["Date","2020-12-31T00:00:00.000Z"],[351,352,353],"Full stack development","Product","Reading",[355,356,357,358],"Book tracking functionality","Social sharing features","Book recommendations","Friend connections",[360,362,365],{category:256,items:361},[293,287,258,249],{category:305,items:363},[364],"Hasura",{category:260,items:366},[262,367,368,369,370,371],"Plausible","Notion","Linear","Figma","Discord",[373,374,375],"Creating a user-friendly book tracking experience","Implementing social features","Building a recommendation system",[377,378,379],"Full-stack development with modern tools","Product development lifecycle","Team collaboration and project management","# Readium\n\nReadium was a project I started with my friend [Kyler](https://www.kyler.design/) during COVID. The aim was to create a book tracking app that was more human-friendly than Goodreads. We wanted to make it easy to track what you read, and to share that with friends. We also wanted to make it easy to find new books to read, and to get recommendations from friends.\n\n## Project Goals\n\n1. Create a more human-friendly alternative to existing book tracking apps\n2. Implement social features for sharing reading progress\n3. Build a recommendation system\n4. Provide an intuitive user interface\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe project was built using a modern tech stack:\n- [React](https://react.dev/) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)\n- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling\n- [Hasura](https://hasura.io/) for the backend\n- Hosted on Vercel\n\n## Development Tools\n\nWe utilized various tools to streamline our development process:\n- [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) for analytics\n- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/product) for documentation\n- [Linear](https://linear.app/) for project management\n- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) for design\n- [Discord](https://discord.com/) for communication\n\n## Project Status\n\nWe launched a beta version but never marketed it to a wider audience. Other commitments led to the project being put on hold. Despite this, the project provided valuable experience in full-stack development and product management.","src/content/projects/readium.mdx","ad8c37fadfc86a67","readium.mdx"];
