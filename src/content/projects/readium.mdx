# Readium

Readium was a project I started with my friend [Kyler](https://www.kyler.design/) during COVID. The aim was to create a book tracking app that was more human-friendly than Goodreads. We wanted to make it easy to track what you read, and to share that with friends. We also wanted to make it easy to find new books to read, and to get recommendations from friends.

## Project Goals

1. Create a more human-friendly alternative to existing book tracking apps
2. Implement social features for sharing reading progress
3. Build a recommendation system
4. Provide an intuitive user interface

## Implementation

The project was built using a modern tech stack:
- [React](https://react.dev/) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling
- [Hasura](https://hasura.io/) for the backend
- Hosted on Vercel

## Development Tools

We utilized various tools to streamline our development process:
- [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) for analytics
- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/product) for documentation
- [Linear](https://linear.app/) for project management
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) for design
- [Discord](https://discord.com/) for communication

## Project Status

We launched a beta version but never marketed it to a wider audience. Other commitments led to the project being put on hold. Despite this, the project provided valuable experience in full-stack development and product management.
