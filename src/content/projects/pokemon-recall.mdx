# Pokemon Recall - Test Your Pokemon Knowledge

A fun side project that combines nostalgia with memory training. Pokemon Recall challenges players to test and improve their knowledge of Pokemon through various recall exercises.

## How It Works

The game presents players with challenges to recall Pokemon based on different criteria - from basic name recognition to more advanced type matchups and evolution chains. Progress is tracked to show improvement over time.

## Why I Built This

As a longtime Pokemon fan, I wanted to create something that combined my love for the franchise with practical memory training techniques. It's a fun way to keep the brain sharp while revisiting childhood favorites.
