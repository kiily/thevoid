There are places in the world that are meeting points of Mother Nature. Set in stone, fortunately still out of our almost godlike control.

The meeting of two ponds, one sea, one ocean, one choppy, one serene. An interesting duality, faithful to the dichotomy of chaos and order. On one side, the waves break the rock, on the other, they roll the sand back and forth with tremendous care.

From the top of Fort Rodney, a defensive outpost built to defend the north of the Caribbean island of St Lucia, with a clear view of the nearby island of Martinique, I decide to immortalize the moment by writing some words and reflect on the privilege of being here.

Despite the cloudy day, the ocean remains ever so beautiful and the wind blows on my hair. I hold my phone tight, I seem to be fond of writing in windy places. Maybe just a metaphor for how far it might take me. As Pessoa puts it: "Some metaphors are more real than some people walking on the street".
