Words may seem completely harmless on their own. Some letters put together, in their essence, somewhat devoid of meaning. They get together to form all the concepts that we use (and misuse). Sure, on their own, they may bear no particular significance or offense, aside from how they are defined. And sure, all is open to interpretation.

However, there are particular concepts where words can be sensitive to people, as they bring up insecurities or memories they may not appreciate or not want to think about. While it is up to each of us to interpret them as we wish, one should be careful of these situations. When a word can hurt someone you love, the meaning can take another dimension. This can be both positive or negative.

Therefore, choose your words wisely. Language matters, language creates meaning, it creates culture. The choice of words can influence behavior, a suggestion against a rule, a prescription against a thought. Choose wisely.
