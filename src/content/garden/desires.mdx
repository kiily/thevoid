Today, it is impossible for me to think about desires. In fact, they weigh on my mind less than a grain of sand. They are understood for the illusions that they are, promises of attainment. Should we fulfill them? Then what? What is the next step in this journey? Do we find ourselves devoid of meaning? Do we realize that we had none to begin with?

The mind is a fickle thing in an endless pursuit to establish itself as an entity that we can point to. Upon closer inspection, desires are things of the mind - they are elaborate ways we lie to ourselves, only to miss out on the grounding and beautiful experience that is life.

Aside from the dopaminergic drive for survival, where do they serve us? Most of us don't even need to survive anymore (and should be grateful for it). So why do we cling on? Why do we keep attaching ourselves to desires of the body and mind? Why do we always desire an answer rather than another question?

One to ask yourself.
