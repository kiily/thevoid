"What is life? If but a fleeting moment of existence, a shadow of an infinite universe. Pictures of old capturing a single snapshot, a unique frame of this life, remind us that we are just mortals. Even in ecstasy, when we sometimes dare to feel like the gods themselves, reality tends to crush us in one way or the other... We see those we love grow old and wrinkly only to then experience those changes ourselves. Our years of youthful energy being but a memory, a synaptic connection in our brain that got lucky enough to be reinforced.

Is this life worth living you may ask? As there is no other choice, we must agree it is. Would we be writing about it if we were not alive? Even in the darkest moments, even when all seems unfair, saddened by the weight of the world, we can snatch a smile, we can reminisce. We must remind ourselves of our human condition, as depressing as it may sound at times. The intent being to recognize that each moment around us is something we should cherish, something we should value and pay close attention to.

I can't help but feel like a hypocrite writing this, as I stare yet again at my phone's screen... I must make a conscious effort to not use it as much as I have been. I digress.

There is beauty in this limit that nature imposes on us. We call it the circle of life. If the circle is the most perfect of shapes, isn't our death a form of final perfection in itself? Like the closing of a loop, bringing the universe to that final equilibrium it always yearns and always finds."
