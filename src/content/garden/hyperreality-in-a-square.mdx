### *12/10/2021 - London*

I glance up and focus on a squared section of a white wall slightly greyed out with time, but only ever so slightly. A few marks in this wall tell me someone tried to remove the carefully positioned chair and hit the wall unknowingly. Like a detective, I examine my square, I squeeze the juice out of it. 

White, plain, but with so much to tell. What would this square have seen if it were alive? What if I was confined to just that space myself? 

I notice another mark, this one, isolated, on a side, similar to the insect blood that stays behind when we crush them with no mercy. As my eyes focus closer, I notice that it is a dent, a small dent, perhaps made by someone crashing into this wall or some object puncturing it accidentally. I keep scanning the square and the reflection of the light tricks my eyes. I seem to see lines, shades of white and grey, like stripes in a football shirt. I notice how the frame of my glasses seems to be in the way of some level of observation.

Plain, the immovable wall continues its stare contest. It curves on its right-hand side into an arch that connects with the same wall on the other side, creating a small concave space where the light reflects in a blue/green hue. After careful observation, I realize that the white is merely an illusion of my brain and is more of a very light, almost baby blue. 

How could I get these confused? I do not know... But my brain likes to play tricks, especially in the morning. As the words get written into the paper, I stare back and observe. 

Suddenly, boredom returns to the room... Time to finish.
