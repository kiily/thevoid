*23/11/2022 - Playing with words*

There are considerations one must take into account and hopefully convey them as best as possible within the confines of the language.

Is there a thought without a thinker?

If thought is, then what thought it?

If there must be a thinker

How does the thinker know it thinks?

Is it because thought thinks itself a thinker?

Thought needs the thinker

The thinker needs the thought

Do they exist independently?

Who came first, the chicken or the egg? 

I suppose they both did, never, and at exactly the same time.
