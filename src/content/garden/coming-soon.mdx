I will keep this first post brief. This is a space where you will find all manner of random thoughts that might have come to my mind at some point this year (until I figure out what people enjoy or do not).

I aim for this to be the start of my journey towards improving my writing and giving the curious (myself included!) a small window into what went through my mind. There will be texts in different languages.

If you are still here, hope you enjoy at least one of the pieces ahead…

If you want to support this and help me with accountability/motivation, tell your friends!
