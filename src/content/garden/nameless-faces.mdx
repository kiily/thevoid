I watch the sea, intently.

As the surf comes and goes

In the crest of each wave

A nameless face

One that has gone

Without a trace

---

As the sun lights them

Escaping from his cloud

They come and go

And so do I

---

Looking at the world

With a keen eye

I see it all

But "nothing" is there

There is beauty

In the unseen

Behind the curtains of this scene

---

They came before

And won't be back

They are the future, the present

And the past

I am them, and they are me

The world comes full circle

In this bit of sea
