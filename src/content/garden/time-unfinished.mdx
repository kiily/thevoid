Time…

Time and time again

Where does it stop?

Where does it end?

Time that always flows

Wishing it would go

When the spirits are low

Riding on the fast tide

When the spirits are high

Linear or looping

It races in mysterious ways

Could we make it still

Yet still spend our days?

Once it catches up to me

What then?
