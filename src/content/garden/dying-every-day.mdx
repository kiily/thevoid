Can you die every day? Can you let go of all the things you will immediately lose when you are dead, but do so today?

Can you be rid of all your attachments, just like death would strip you of them, but today? Even better, can you be rid of them right now, and then again and again?

If you do so, what is found on the other end? The experience is for each of us to find out

If you "die" to things, you are, in a sense, reborn and ready to meet them for the first time. Like a child discovering a wonderous world ahead of them.

Do you think peace and freedom can be found there?
