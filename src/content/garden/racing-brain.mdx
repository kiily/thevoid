A constant race in my brain ... Ideas popping into my mind, constantly. Many goals I feel capable of achieving, many ideas I want to test out, and one nemesis: *time*. Time is a killer, hacking slowly at me with every second it passes. I feel it on others around me, more than I feel it on myself but it is inevitable nonetheless. Time cuts, sometimes racing, other times slowing down. It is the unavoidable reality of life, that leads to one of the everlasting truths; for some, the only truth.

My brain races... In a futile attempt to stop what will come, in its own worries and problems. Wrapped in its insecurities, in its successes, and in its failures. So much that has already happened and so much that is yet to happen. Most times I have a positive outlook but some days it is difficult to maintain it. Difficult to accept this race against myself, difficult to accept that it will be impossible to achieve. As Fernando Pessoa puts it, such is the "Pain of thinking"...
