My attempt at FLOWN's February challenge of writing a creative piece containing the following words:

1. GEL 2. TROUSERS 3. RENEWED 4. DEEP 5. MARQUEE 6. TRUNDLED

7. CABLE 8. DOGGED 9. HAYSTACK 10. SEEPAGE 11. CONDUCT 12. WALRUS

13. MULTIPLY 14. EARNEST 15. LUCKIEST 16. OPENING 17. ASSOCIATION

18. BURRITO 19. GLOBULE 20. FLOCK.

*I did have to google some of these words as they were new to me, let's hope I used them well :)*

## Through the eyes of children

Children have the earnest of eyes

They let their imagination multiply

Whether dogged or deep in their fun

Thinking of a walrus eating a burrito,

In a marquee, under the sun.

The luckiest of them

May even imagine red globules

Like a flock of birds, wearing trousers, a true gem!

Imagination has no rules

The seepage of ideas is eternally renewed.

Flash forward,

Connect the cable to the future:

Some will gel their hair,

Conduct themselves as adults as well

We must take life seriously...

Gone is that power of association

That bliss of ignorance

And the beauty of it may never come back

It becomes like finding a needle in a haystack.

Trundled away with age.
