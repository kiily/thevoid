I ask myself this often. Where does my resistance to doing X or Y come from? Why is it there? Why do I struggle with it? For a long time, I have resisted and even repressed my journey into writing. I justified it with endless, so-called "reasons". All along the same lines... What if the work is not perfect? What if I am not ready for the criticisms of others? What if ...

It is easy to realize how these are completely unjustified blockers but people still find it hard to act and to embrace their inner passion. It is our Ego that breeds this Resistance and pushes us away from taking that risk. After all, it seems happy with a stable and predictable life.

I have come to think of the arts as something mystic, that arises from something greater than ourselves. Whatever its shape, origin, or form, inspiration is a tricky phenomenon to explain. I hope that through facing my own Resistance, I will be able to understand it further.
