Time, time, time... Why is it always flying inside my head? This topic, this unhappiness with the way that time has been dictated or created to stay. We all worry about what we are doing, about what we want to do, what we want to become? But when? When are we? When? This is the real question. Timing is everything, time is a commodity, the biggest of them all. Yet, we seem to not take this with all the seriousness that should come with it. The impressive effects of timing have been made clearer to me with an overwhelming amount of research (I really should go read some of those papers). While it's hard to be able to dissect the full veracity of all this information, all I can do is start by trusting it. It makes sense to me, that timing greatly influences performance, alertness, and mood.

Time often is more important than place. Chronobiology is inevitable, like Death itself, a part of the Whole. A part of the cycle of nature that we seem so set to entrain... We want this timing ingrained in ourselves, in the name of "productivity". The irony is, this mentality, which results in a massively flawed educational system, is old and non-sensical. With the rise of multisensory stimuli around us, and the brain on constant overdrive, breaks are an essential, non-negotiable part of productivity. So go forth, be productive, rest, and play. Take a nap, take a deep breath, fight your day head-on, with intent.
